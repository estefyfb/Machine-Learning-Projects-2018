# Machine-Learning-Projects-2018

These projects were created by a 4-person team

## 1_EDA_Dimensionality Reduction
We perform exploratory data analysis on the Ames housing data set and utilize PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.

## 2_LogisticRegression
We classify houses in the Ames housing data set into low, medium, and high price ranges via a custom implementation of logistic regression. 

## 3_MLP
We classify houses in the Ames housing data set into low, medium, and high price ranges via a custom implementation of a multi-layer perceptron.

## 4_CNN
We classify images in the Colorectal Histology MNIST data set using CNNs and compare performance of different CNN architectures. 

## 5_RNN
We classified the Twitter U.S. Airline Sentiment dataset, which consists of tweets from February 2015 about 6 major U.S. airlines. The data is classified into positive, negative, and neutral tweets using different RNN architectures.
