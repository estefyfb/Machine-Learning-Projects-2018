## 1_EDA_Dimensionality Reduction
We perform exploratory data analysis on the Ames housing data set and utilize PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction

## 2_LogisticRegression
We classify houses in the Ames housing data set into low, medium, and high price ranges via a custom implementation of logistic regression. 

## 3_MLP
We classify houses in the Ames housing data set into low, medium, and high price ranges via a custom implementation of a multi-layer perceptron
