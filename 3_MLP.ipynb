        "For this lab, we chose the same dataset as lab one: Ames Housing Data. Our task is to classify houses into one of three price ranges based on the various attributes of the property (# of bedrooms, square footage, year built, etc). Our price ranges are labeled as 0, 1, 2 to represent a low, medium, and high price.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the buyers, it will be convenient for them to narrow down the house choices within their budget range by selecting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, garage types and other features when they are in the house market.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, for sellers such as real estate or construction company, it is crucial to understand which type of houses or floor plan are more desirable in the market. Predicting the sales prices of different type of houses not only helps them optimize their asset acquisition or construction plan, it also leads to quicker asset turn over and smooth sales process. Ultimately a greater profit is achieved. It would also be important for a real estate company to predict the price range of a house specifically for meeting quotas. Sales representatives often have quotas to meet each business quarter for their sales. Understanding the predicted price range of a property will allow a sales rep to push more towards certain kinds of properties in order to meet these quotas. Sellers can use our algorithm as a guide to price their properties. \n",
        "\n",
        "There are two possible types of misclassification in our dataset - one is between adjacent categories (low, medium and medium, high) and the other is between low and high sales price categories. Our algorithm would not be useful for realtors if there are any misclassifications between lowest and highest priced houses. This would not only show that the algorithm does not work but could also lead to a significant loss of revenue for the seller. There is a little more room for error for houses that might be on the borderline between price ranges. Zillow uses Zestimates to predict house prices. According to https://www.zillow.com/zestimate/, the Zestimate was within 20% of the transaction price for 87.6% of properties across the U.S. Using this number as a rough guideline, we can estimate that the algorithm would still be useful with about a 10% misclassification rate for houses that are on the borderline between price ranges.

Instead of having a continuous response variable, we now have a categorical response with 3 different levels of pricing so we can use multi level classification. We used the distribution of SalePrice, which we investigated in lab one, to determine how to split the prices into ranges. A house with sale price less than 130,000 dollars is assigned to the lowest price range \"0\" and houses with sale price above 210,000 dollars are assigned to the highest price range \"2\". We also used MinMax Scaler to normalize our data.\n",

This uses up the seller's time and resources while this time could have been spent selling an additional property. \n",

To choose the costs, we calculated the difference between median sales price for each pair of price range categories to have an estimate of how much the misclassification would cost the seller. Then, we set the misclassification between lowest and highest price ranges (0 and 2) to be 100 and normalized the other price differences to this. The resulting cost matrix is depicted below. \n"

        "To begin tuning our parameters, we used stratified 10-fold cross validation and performed a grid search with all combinations of cost and activation functions used in the models. Within each fold, we used the confusion matrix and our chosen cost matrix to evaluate the performance of the models. The boxplot above shows similar performance for all the models. The lowest mean cost of ~32,000 was attained with the quadratic cost function and sigmoid activation function.  \n",

        "As stated earlier, we can estimate that the algorithm would still be useful with about a 10% misclassification rate for houses that are on the borderline between price ranges. With 263 observations in our validation set, this means we could incorrectly classify at most 26 properties. We do not want any these errors to occur in the upper right or lower left corners of the confusion matrix. If all errors occured at a position between the lowest and middle price range, overall cost would be (26 x 33 = 858). If all errors occured at a position between the middle and highest price range, overall cost would be (26 x 67 = 1,742). When evaluating our model on the validation dataset, any overall cost below ~1700 would be acceptable. However, we see that all models perform with costs between 30,000 and 37,000. "

        "Our final model was successful in not misclassifying any properties between lowest and highest price range. The testing data contains 291 observations. If allowing for 10% misclassification rate, we could at most misclassify 29 houses. The highest acceptable cost would be (29 x 67) 1,943. The cost of misclassification for the final model was 37,915, so, we would not recommend this model for deployment since it's not likely to be useful for realtors. "

        "The sigmoid activation function achieved the lowest mean misclassification cost in this test set, but it also has high variance. While the relu activation function has the second lowest mean misclassification cost, it has the least variance of all the models. When comparing the relu and silu functions, it appears using relu is slightly better because the variance is smaller. It is difficult to pick a best model here. Regardless, the misclassification costs for all are over the threshold to be useful for realtors, so we would not recommend any of these models for deployment. "
