        "For this lab, we chose the same dataset as lab one: Ames Housing Data. Our task is to classify houses into one of three price ranges based on the various attributes of the property (# of bedrooms, square footage, year built, etc). Our price ranges are labeled as 0, 1, 2 to represent a low, medium, and high price.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the buyers, it will be convenient for them to narrow down the house choices within their budget range by selecting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, garage types and other features when they are in the house market.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, for sellers such as real estate or construction company, it is crucial to understand which type of houses or floor plan are more desirable in the market. Predicting the sales prices of different type of houses not only helps them optimize their asset acquisition or construction plan, it also leads to quicker asset turn over and smooth sales process. Ultimately a greater profit is achieved. It would also be important for a real estate company to predict the price range of a house specifically for meeting quotas. Sales representatives often have quotas to meet each business quarter for their sales. Understanding the predicted price range of a property will allow a sales rep to push more towards certain kinds of properties in order to meet these quotas. \n",
        "\n",
        "We envision that our model would be deployed, so that it provides predictions in real time and it's continually updated with new data. We would want our classification model to be used specifically for sellers. Therefore, it's important that the model be continually updated since housing prices change each year. If we were to use an offline model, our prediction of housing prices in the future would solely be based on the historical data. This is not good statistical practice for our data set because we only have information on the properties sold during 2006-2010. If we tried to use this offline model to predict the price range for a house currently on sale in Ames, Iowa we would be extrapolating for our classification. Also, using an offline model means that our method could quickly become irrelevant. We might be able to make accurate predictions for the test data but as time goes on and the market changes the perform will go down. For these reasons, we believe our classification task would be better as a deployed model and will be more relevant to sellers as such.\n",

Instead of having a continuous response variable, we now have a categorical response with 3 different levels of pricing so we can use multi level classification. We used the distribution of SalePrice, which we investigated in lab one, to determine how to split the prices into ranges. A house with sale price less than 130,000 dollars is assigned to the lowest price range \"0\" and houses with sale price above 210,000 dollars are assigned to the highest price range \"2\".\n",

        "Having 80% split into the training set is good for our data set since we don't have that many observations to begin with. Our data set has 2930 observations, so the split will be: 2344 observations to train and 586 observations to test. We don't want to have too few observations in our training model or too few to test so we will keep to the 80/20 split. Also, from the visualization of Price_Range in the two data sets, we see that the same proportion of classes are represented in each set. We have 50% of the observations from the middle price range and 25% each from the low and high price ranges. This is good because if the 80/20 split resulted in extreme class imbalances in the two sets, we would not want to use that for training and testing. Lastly, our data is not of a time series kind. Even though we have a Year built attribute, the other attributes are not dependent on this measure of time. So randomly splitting our data into 2 sets does not distort any of the relationships between the predictors and our response, like it would if our data was time dependent."

Whenever we used L2 regularization with either steepest descent or stochastic gradient descent, accuracy was mostly around 0.3 for majority of the C values. When using L1 for these two methods, accuracy with higher, normally around 0.5 for majority of the C values. It is interesting to see that for steepest descent using L2 regularization, the accuracy was always above 0.5 whenever C was greater than 0.8"

However, a better performing model does not necessarily mean that the model will work better in general, rather it is affected by the specific data patterns in the test set. In that sense, our selection of parameters based on the model performance in the test set is not justified since the improvement in the model may simply be due to chance. In fact, if we run our optimization of C over again with a different 80/20 data split, we would return a different optimal C each time.\n",

        "We would recommend the scikit-learn logistic regression. Although our implementation achieved a higher accuracy score than scikit-learn (73% vs 64%)**, these accuracy scores are specific to this data. In fact, we got different accuracy scores everytime we ran our code. So, it might be that scikit-learn outperforms our custom method on a different data set, and the accuracy scores aren't different enough that we would base our recommendation on that alone.\n",
